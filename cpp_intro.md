# Basics 

* Each C++ program consists of two parts: the preprocessor directives and the main function
  - Preprocessor starts with `#`
* `const`: Value does not change for the life of the program.
* File IO
  - `ofstream`(for writing): always have the flag `ios:out` enabled, plug any specified flag 
  - `ifstream`(for reading): similar to `ofstream`
  -  `fstream`(both reading and writing) default flag `ios::int` and `ios::int`, but would be overriden by specified flag.
